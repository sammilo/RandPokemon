# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Samantha Milo**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Summary

**RandPokemon** is an android app that displays a random pokemon (name, image, and type(s)) using the Pokemon API.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ‘»ðŸ‘¾ðŸŽ®**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **Pokemon API**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

Views that remain static do not need to be imported into MainActivity.kt, but views that will change or are interactable (buttons, dynamic data, etc) do need to be imported.
